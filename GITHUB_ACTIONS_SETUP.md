# GitHub Actions CI/CD - Setup Complete! ✅

## 🎉 What I've Done

I've successfully implemented a **complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** for
your project!

### Files Created/Updated:

1. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** - Main CI/CD workflow
2. **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore file for build artifacts

## 📋 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Commit and Push the Changes

```bash
# The files are already staged, just commit them
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab at the top
3. You should see the CI pipeline running automatically!

## 🚀 What the CI Pipeline Does

The pipeline runs **automatically** on:

- Every push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Every pull request to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual trigger (via GitHub Actions tab)

### Job 1: Test Job ✅

- Sets up Dart SDK
- Installs dependencies
- Checks code formatting
- Runs static analysis
- Executes all tests with proper environment variables
- Generates test coverage report (optional)

### Job 2: Docker Job 🐳

- Builds Docker image using multi-stage Dockerfile
- Starts the container
- Tests health endpoint
- Tests API endpoints (GET and POST)
- Saves Docker image as artifact

### Job 3: Summary 📊

- Shows overall status of all jobs
- Provides clear pass/fail status

## 📊 Viewing CI Results

### On GitHub:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on any workflow run
3. View detailed logs for each step

### Status Indicators:

- ✅ **Green checkmark** = All tests passed
- ❌ **Red X** = Tests failed
- 🟡 **Yellow dot** = Tests running

## 🔧 Testing Locally (Optional)

You can run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
dart pub get

# Check formatting
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .

# Run static analysis
dart analyze --fatal-infos

# Run tests
dart test --reporter=expanded

# Test Docker build
docker build -t dart-tech-test:local .
docker run -d --name test -p 8080:8080 dart-tech-test:local
curl http://localhost:8080/health
docker stop test && docker rm test
```

## ❓ Do You Need Docker Desktop?

### For GitHub Actions: **NO** ❌

- GitHub Actions has Docker pre-installed
- Everything runs automatically in the cloud
- You don't need Docker on your machine for CI to work

### For Local Development: **OPTIONAL** ⚠️

- Only needed if you want to test Docker builds locally
- Not required for the CI pipeline to work
- The Dockerfile is ready and will work in GitHub Actions

## 🎯 What Happens After You Push?

1. You push the code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions automatically starts
3. Runs all tests in parallel
4. Builds and tests Docker container
5. Shows you the results in the Actions tab
6. You get email notifications if tests fail (optional)

## ✅ Environment Variables

The CI pipeline automatically sets these environment variables:

- `API_KEYS`: `test:standard:enhanced:enterprise`
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: `100`
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SEC`: `60`

No configuration needed on your part!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail on GitHub but Pass Locally:

- Check the logs in the Actions tab
- Environment variables might be different
- OS differences (GitHub uses Ubuntu, you're on Windows)

### If Docker Build Fails:

- Check the Docker job logs
- The multi-stage build is already optimized
- Dependencies are properly configured

### Need to Re-run a Failed Build?

1. Go to the failed workflow run
2. Click "Re-run all jobs" button
3. Or "Re-run failed jobs" to save time

## 🎊 Summary

**You're all set!** Just commit and push the changes, and your CI/CD pipeline
will be live!

```bash
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

Then visit your GitHub repo's **Actions** tab to see it in action! 🚀
